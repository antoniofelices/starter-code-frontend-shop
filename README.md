# Sprint 2.2 IT Academy | Shop

## Description

A basic e-commerce exercise base on [this instrucccions](https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/starter-code-frontend-shop/blob/main/README.md)

Dividing functions into modules. Each module has a single responsibility.
Like any e-commerce, you could add products to the shopping cart, apply discounts, remove products, etc.

### Some decisions

-   Use Vite as a development tool.
-   Refactor the base project structure to split JavaScript files into modules.
-   Removed Bootstrap as a CDN link. Added as a package and then import the just the styles I need.
-   Use event listeners to manipulate the DOM.
-   Use RegEx to validate form inputs.

## Technologies

-   JavaScript.
-   Bootstrap.
-   Vite.

## Requirements

-   Node.js v23.9.0
-   npm v11.2.0
